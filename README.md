# **CalmConnections**
## Transforming Mental Health Care

CalmConnections is a mental health App that focuses on delivering most of the features to users who in other words, are not able to access them. This includes access to professional therapists that are located worldwide, handpicked useful resources, tip and coping mechanisms as well as journaling and recording your feelings. 

This app is to close the bridge between somewhat disadvantaged patients and professional experts. It is mainly to link younger users, this being people who age between 12 years and onwards. 

Features: 
Comprehensive Library of useful information and resources, composed by professionals to help gain an insight into different aspects of mental health
Therapists and Psychologists where sessions can be booked. Communication can be done via phone calls, emails, video calls or messaging.
A page dedicated specifically to meditation tips and calming soothing music and techniques.
A chatroom and forum where the patients can participate in discussions to meet more people who are like-minded. 
A journal and diary where patients can record and jot down their feelings and emotions, and reflections for the day

The Next Steps: 
Prerequisites: 
For smoother and better performance, ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your machine
One would need to download certain images attached in the folders as well in order for the images to be presented and the application to run smoothly. 
Steps: 
You should start on the main index page of the HTML document, which should lead the user to the landing page, where there are 2 options to either create an account or just register with their old one. 
Once the user has registered or logged in, they have the option to log their emotions or skip and navigate to the rest of the application. 
From there, the user has a variety of options of activities they would like to engage in on the application such as joining a forum, reading about mental disorders, music & meditation techniques or having sessions with professionally trained therapists.
